## Additional Clauses (Not Legally Binding, But Morally Encouraged)

1. **Musical Taste Disclaimer**: By using this software, you acknowledge that your musical taste will be publicly exposed, and you cannot blame us when people discover your secret Nickelback obsession.

2. **Rickroll Immunity**: The maintainers of this project cannot be held liable for any psychological damage caused by being programmatically Rickrolled.

3. **Cassette Nostalgia**: If using this software causes a temporal paradox where cassette tapes become popular again, we'll take partial credit.

4. **Shame Indemnification**: We accept no responsibility for the shame you may feel when your friends discover that "Baby Shark" is in your top played.

Remember: This is a real MIT license up there ☝️. The fun stuff down here is just for laughs.
