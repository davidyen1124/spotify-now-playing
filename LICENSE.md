# "Why Would Anyone Steal This" License

Version 1.0, (Because We Definitely Need Version Control For This)

## Terms and Conditions

1. **You Can Take It**: Feel free to copy, modify, or do whatever the heck you want with this code. Seriously, we're flattered you think it's worth stealing.

2. **Attribution**: If you actually use this code, please include a note saying "Powered by questionable code from that Spotify Now Playing thing" so others know who to blame.

3. **No Warranty**: This software is provided "as is," which is developer-speak for "it barely works on my machine, good luck on yours."

4. **Musical Taste Clause**: By using this software, you acknowledge that your musical taste will be publicly exposed, and you cannot sue us when people discover your secret Nickelback obsession.

5. **Rickroll Immunity**: The maintainers of this project cannot be held liable for any psychological damage caused by being programmatically Rickrolled.

6. **AWS Bill Protection**: We are not responsible for any AWS charges incurred because you deployed this to show off to three people who visited your link once.

7. **Causality Waiver**: If using this software causes a temporal paradox where cassette tapes become popular again, that's on you.

8. **Hipster Clause**: If you tell people you were using this "before it was cool," we reserve the right to publicly mock you, especially since it will never be cool.

9. **Shame Indemnification**: We accept no responsibility for the shame you may feel when your friends discover that you still listen to your middle school playlist from 2007.

10. **Forbidden Use**: This software must not be used to:

    - Make money (as if you could)
    - Impress potential dates (it won't work)
    - Convince people you have good music taste (we're exposing the truth, remember?)

11. **Termination**: This license is automatically terminated if you use this project in a TikTok. Have some dignity.

12. **Jurisdiction**: Any disputes shall be settled via a dance-off to the most embarrassing song in your Spotify history.

(We had to include that last paragraph because our lawyer insisted on having at least one serious-looking section, even though we all know this project isn't serious enough to warrant legal protection.)
